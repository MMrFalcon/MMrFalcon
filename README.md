### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Jakub, a Full Stack Developer with a passion for building robust and scalable web applications. I leverage my expertise in Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MicroPython with Raspberry Pi Pico to craft innovative solutions.

âœ¨**Technical Skills:**

* **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, RESTful APIs
* **Frontend:** Familiarity with HTML, CSS, Angular
* **Hardware:** MicroPython, Raspberry Pi Pico
* **Linux:** Comfortable navigating the Linux command line. I really enjoy using Ubuntu and Raspbian. Familarity with: Apche2, Systemd, Iptables.
* **Docker:** To accelerate database environment creation and application containerization

**Projects:**
* [Websites Health Check](https://github.com/MMrFalcon/health-check) Necessity is the mother of invention. I had to figure out when my router needed a port forwarding reset to host a website. With this tool, I check if it returns a status != 200 and send an email to my inbox.
* [Pico Home Hub](https://github.com/MMrFalcon/Pico-Home-Hub) Raspberry Pi Pico program for IoT, incorporating Wi-Fi, RTC, and soil moisture sensor libraries for lighting control and temperature measurement.
* [Movies](https://github.com/MMrFalcon/movies) A quick knowledge pill on simple use cases of JpaSpecificationExecutor in building filtering and how to optimize these queries.

âœ¨**Currently Exploring:**
* Real-time IoT solutions with: Project Reactor (Spring WebFlux, Mongo DB) and Raspberry Pi Pico
